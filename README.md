# Part - 1 - Layout

Finish the layout with HTML and CSS. Here are some ideas to do it:
- Create four squares and give the border-radius to only one corner. üü•üü®üü©üü¶
- Have a `score-container` which is absolutely positioned and has the same background as body, position it in the center to make it look like a hole üç©
- Add the button and give it a neon effect by using colored shadow ‚å®Ô∏è
- Add the text as required, use a cool fancy font, after all it's a game üïπ
- To give the glow effect on click, you should write some css targeting `:active` pseudo-class.

# Part - 2 - JS Setup

We will be writing the game such that it works in console first. Once we get the logic right then we will link it to the UI.
- Imagine you have four color choices `R`, `Y`, `G`, `B`, and each level will be a combination of these colors.
- Level 1 will have 1 color, level 2 will have 2 colors, so any 2 random colors from this.
- Write a function `getNewWord()` which given a level number returns a random combination of these colors (letters).
- Write a function `play()` which keeps track of the current score, current word (by calling the previously written function), tap counts, word so far, etc.

# Part - 3 - Binding the HTML with JS

This is tricky because we still be writing lot of JS code here.
- Create refrences (variables) to all required elements, score text, tap count, each color div, start game button, score container etc.
- Create an object which has key as alphabet `R` and value as color `red` so you can use it to access those elements and colors.
- Write a function called `animate` which will take a word like `RYB` and animate each colored div for 0.5s. One way to animate is to add a shadow and remove it after `0.5s` and do it for each div one by one.
- After animation is finished now it's user's turn to guess the color sequence played. So update the taps count remaining based on the level.
- For each tap the user does reduce the count and store the guess in a string, and when tap count reaches 0 check if the user has got the correct sequence or not
- If the user gets correct sequence then update the score and go to next level, else show the final score and start over.
